          <h3>Website Design & Development</h3>
          <p>I started learning to code once we were all forced home due to COVID-19. I've always had an interest in coding but was unsure it was something I could do well. It turns out I have a knack for programming and it has become something I love to do! I plan to continue pursuing my education by any means and building my professional portfolio.</p>

          <h3>Landscape and Urban Photography</h3>
          <p class="clear">Photography is something I've always loved. I admire people who can capture the beauty in the everyday and mundane things we take for granted. My passion is in capturing landscape and urban photography! Maybe one day I'll feel comfortable enough sharing my work with the world but not quite there yet!</p>
